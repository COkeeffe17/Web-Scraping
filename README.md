# Web-Scraping
This is a project in which I will be learning/implementing web-scraping.

# Where?

I am testing this using a website called webscraper.io/test-sites. Now I believe this website exists to test another webscraper; the one the website is actually advertising/selling. But I thought it was perfect to test my own web-scraper on. It features various levels of difficulty by adding more and more layers of complexity in order to scrape the necessary data (shown below).

# What am I doing?

To start with I will create a web-scraping program with a couple of key features (nothing crazy, this is just a test). From there I will adjust the program to work on the following level, causing the program to evolve to become more robust and resilient in the face of awkward website design.
